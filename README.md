# A functional solver for word equations with regular constraints

This is my master's thesis on **extending the Nielsen transformation with regex derivatives** to solve regex-constrained word equations.

You can find the thesis under [thesis.pdf](./thesis.pdf) and the presentation slides under [presentation.pdf](./presentation.pdf).
