\begin{abstract}
    We present a prefix-based approach for solving regex-constrained word equations combining the Nielsen transformation and Brzozowski derivatives. Differently from most approaches, we solve the word equation and the regex constraints in a combined manner. We provide a Haskell implementation of a solver using our approach. Our implementation outperforms state-of-the-art solvers on regex-constrained, quadratic equations.
    Since our approach is only viable within this particular niche, we conclude it is best suited as a solver tactic, as opposed to a standalone solver.
